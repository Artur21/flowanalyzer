This is a loose roadmap of the features being developed for the Flow Analyzer project in no particular order.

# sFlow Support

There have been a number of requests to support this protocol, and due to its adoption across the networking industry it seems to be a worthwhile addition to the project.

**Status**: Currently basic sFlow support has been developed in the sFlow branch, and support for standard sFlow (Enterprise 0) samples are supported.

# J-Flow Support

With J-Flow being Netflow compatible we should be able to onboard the protocol fairly quickly. Considering the size of Juniper in the networking market it's important that we make sure Flow Analyzer is compatible.

**Status**: J-Flow development and testing hasn't begun yet.
